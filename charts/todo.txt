* TODO Perl::Formance plugins for interesting code
** Mostly taken from perl release changelogs
** The entries marked with '+' seem to sound more relevant.

** 5.22
   - length is up to 20% faster for non-magical/non-tied scalars
     containing a string if it is a non-utf8 string or if use
     bytes; is in scope.
   + @array = split
   - join is now subject to constant folding. 
   - qq(@array) is implemented using two ops: a stringify op and a
     join op. If the qq contains nothing but a single array, the
     stringification is optimized away.
   - our $var and our($s,@a,%h) in void context are no longer evaluated at run time.
   + Subroutines with an empty prototype and bodies containing
     just undef are now eligible for inlining.
   + Hash lookups where the key is a constant is faster.
   - 
** 5.20
   + DONE: 5.20 subroutines: FibOOSig
   + iterate very large arrays
     (>2**31 elements, stress 64bit support, 5.20+)
   + regex on very large strings
     (>2**31 characters, 5.20+)
   + -Accflags=-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE (5.20+)
   - -Accflags=-DPERL_NO_COW (5.20+)
   + regexes with ^ anchors
   - Precomputed hash values are now used in more places during
     method lookup.
   + Constant hash key lookups ($hash{key} as opposed to
     $hash{$key}) on hash slices
   + optimization on last return: sub baz { return $cat }
   + creation of certain sorts of lists, including array and hash
     slices
   + optimisation for arrays indexed with a small constant integer
     is now applied for integers in the range -128..127, rather
     than 0..255.  This should speed up Perl code using expressions
     like $x[-1].
   + The first iteration over a large hash (using "keys" or "each")
     is now faster.
   + Dereferencing (as in "$obj->[0]" or "$obj->{k}") is now faster
     when $obj is an instance of a class that has overloaded
     methods, but doesn't overload any of the dereferencing methods
     "@{}", "%{}", and so on.
   - Perl now does less disk I/O when dealing with Unicode
     properties that cover up to three ranges of consecutive code
     points.
** 5.18
   - 
** 5.16
   - performance for Unicode properties in regular expressions
   - "local $_" is faster now
   - Perl 5.12.0 sped up the destruction of objects whose
     classes define empty "DESTROY" methods (to prevent autoloading),
     by simply not calling such empty methods.  This release takes
     this optimization a step further, by not calling any "DESTROY"
     method that begins with a "return" statement.  This can be useful
     for destructors that are only used for debugging:

     use constant DEBUG => 1;
     sub DESTROY { return unless DEBUG; ... }
   - Assigning to a variable that holds a typeglob or
     copy-on-write scalar is now much faster.
   - "substr" no longer calculates a value to return when
     called in void context.
   + Perl's "glob" function and its "<...>" equivalent are now
     much faster.
   - short-circuiting operators "&&", "||", and "//", when
     chained (such as "$a || $b || $c"), are now considerably faster
     to short-circuit
   - The implementation of "s///r" makes one fewer copy of the
     scalar's value.
** 5.14
   - compare traditional and terse Array and hash container
     functions, which now accept references (push $ref, $value) - try
     many iterations or large arrays - probably just compiler change
   - measure reduced hashes' memory overhead
   + fewer OPs are used for shift() and pop() calls with no
     argument (with implicit @_).  This change makes shift() 5%
     faster than "shift @_" on non-threaded perls, and 25% faster on
     threaded ones.
   - case-insensitive comparison of utf8 strings
   + String appending is up to 100 times faster
   + optimisation to speed up "my @array = ..." and "my %hash = ..." assignments
     (though triggered bug in 5.12.0!)
   - @_ uses less memory
   + thread shared variable access
