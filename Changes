        - support for -DNO_TAINT_SUPPORT in metainfo
        - options --tap et al. to generate TAP with embedded results

0.53      2016-04-23
        - fix calling benchmarkanything reporting

0.52      2016-04-22
        - fix rxmicro bug [rurban]
        - scale down RxMicro in 'fast' mode

0.51      2016-03-31
        - allow cygwin on AssertOS
          (because cpantesters matrix was GREEN there)

0.50      2016-03-30
        - assert OS=Unix for the time being

0.49      2015-10-01
        - better error handling for executing plugins

0.48      2015-09-25
        - fix error catching in Shootout wrapper

0.47      2015-09-24
        - fix error reporting in some Shootout plugins

0.46      2015-09-24
        - no compile tests for benchmark plugins, as they
          depend on optional CPAN deps

0.45      2015-09-24
        - --benchmarkanything-report now uses more lightweight
          BenchmarkAnything::Reporter for sending results via HTTP
        - no more checking if receiver exists before we run benchmark, as
          it was not reliable anyway.
        - instead we now have a more robust local result file writing in
          case report sending fails

0.44      2015-09-22
        - new modes --benchmarkanything[-report]
            --benchmarkanything
              enables other options to do The Right Thing for storing
              results in a BenchmarkAnything store (but does not send).
            --benchmarkanything-report
              additionally sends the results by using
              BenchmarkAnything::Storage::Frontend::Lib which in turn
              follows its configuration
        - With those you should never think about storing your results,
          for more info see http://benchmarkanything.org
        - store perlformance env vars
          env vars of ^perlformance_ become env_perlformance_...

0.43      2015-09-03
        - yet another accessor benchmark: Moo

0.42      2015-09-03
        - new benchmarks for several accessor modules

0.41      2015-09-03
        - new regex benchmarks (RxMicro.*)

0.40      2015-04-20
        - new option --outfile=FILE

0.39      2015-04-19
        - split outstyle into --outstyle=yaml and --outstyle=yamlish so we
          can have real YAML and YAMLish suitable for TAP embedding
        - only --outstyle=yamlish applies --indent and --tapdescription
        - --outstyle now case-insensitive

0.38      2015-04-17
        - plugin:MatrixReal - new - pure perl matrix operations
        - plugin:Prime - maintenance - install Math::Primality by default
        - plugin:SpamAssassin - maintenance
        - deps: JSON mandatory

0.37      2015-04-17
        - fix missing dependencies

0.36      2015-04-17
        - meta information overhaul (Sys::Info, Config, Config::Perl::V)
        - metric names now always prefixed with "perlformance.perl5."
        - plugin:FibOOSig - stress functions with signatures
        - plugin:SpamAssassin - reworked, simplified, different runs
        - new option --outstyle=json

0.35      2015-04-06
        - rework metainformation, mostly for Tapper augmentation

0.34      2015-04-05
        - adapt to bootstrap-perl changes
        - carved out cpu speed stabilization code
        - generate results following Tapper's BenchmarkAnythingData schema

0.33      2012-09-19
        - drop tests that require dependencies

0.32      2012-09-18
        - fix dependency cleanup, no more [AutoPrereqs]

0.31      2012-09-07
        - very few dependencies now,
          not even Perl::Formance::Cargo anymore,
          completely rely on Task::PerlFormance for that
        - therefore now more usable for quick microbenchmarks
        - capture more errors and handle gracefully
        - avoid output flooding

0.30      2012-08-17
        - set $0 to plugin name
          (sorry for the micro releases, I'm on vacation :-))

0.29      2012-08-17
        - FibMXDeclare: disabled in --plugins=ALL
          (it is extremely too slow to make any sense)

0.28      2012-08-16
        - Dist::Zill'ified
        - depend on newer Devel::Size
        - remove legacy MooseTS code completely
        - Plugin::DPath without Safe.pm
        - rework P6STD plugin to work again
        - polish debug/verbose output

0.27      2012-05-24
        - conditionally use Devel::Size only if available

0.26      2012-01-26
        - MooseTS: disabled in --plugins=ALL
          This benchmark idea turned out to not work as
          expected. Disable it for easier living.

        - RegexpCommonTS: no more in with prove -Q (quiet) mode as under
          circumstances with 5.9.x quirks that's not available. It makes
          the benchmark slightly slower.

0.25      2012-01-04
        - fix SpamAssassin plugin (set used Bayes plugin explicitely)

0.24      2011-11-22
        - modify variation in exe names for codespeed: now only perl-5.15
          in contrast to perl-5.15.5, but additionally name threads and
          64bit-support.

0.23      2011-08-13
        - Codespeed support
          it can generate additional data blocks in TAP that
          already fit the structure needed by Codespeed
          (http://github.com/tobami/codespeed)

0.22      2010-08-04
        - Big Rescale
          - The --fastmode is now slower but actually returning useful
            values for experimenting speed improvements or configurations.
            This probably makes it the preferred mode for everyday users.
          - The normal mode (targeted to compare real strong machines)
            now takes less time on some crazy workloads that went mental
            even for big machines.

        - some more tests

0.21      2010-07-30
        - Maintenance release
          - fixed missing PLUGIN_VERSION in output
          - fix missing plugin titles
          - document --plugins=ALL
          - drop dependency to Test::Aggregate::Nested (orphaned experiment)

        - introduced an "Incubator" plugin as an experimental,
          non-official playing field

0.20      2010-07-27
        - default set of plugins now "mostly harmless", ie., which
          should work with same dependencies as Perl::Formance itself:
          - Fib FibOO, Mem, Prime, Rx, fasta, regexdna, binarytrees,
            revcomp, nbody, spectralnorm
          - additionaly a new --plugins=ALL option which runs all known
            plugins.

        - all plugins now have their own version numbers

        - RxCmp plugin: new re::engine::RE2

        - Mem plugin: now implemented something

        - Threads plugin:
          - less inner thread overhead
          - divides Threads + ThreadsShared

        - PerlCritic plugin: runs Perl::Critic on itself, using a bundled
          snapshot or the installed CPAN version, both on the snapshot
          code

        - Bugfixes and maintenance
          - forgotten tmpdir cleanups
          - code cleanup for Perl::Critic
          - try hiding bundled code from PAUSE indexer
          - Perl 5.8'ify by using "our"
          - dropped useless exports

        - new option --version
          - in combination with -v prints all plugin versions

        - Stabilize OS run environment (mostly Linux)
          - disk sync
          - flush caches
          - disable Core Performance Boost
          - disable Adress Space Layout Randomization
          - These features will need "root" to have an effect

        - Now every plugin is forked before running.

        - No more all plugin loading at once; as that used to influence
          the runtime of plugins depending on what else was loaded.

0.12      2010-07-13
        - Adapt to changed DPath API v0.40

0.11      2010-07-10
        - Imroved --outstyle=summary output

0.10      2010-07-09
        - introduce output style option
           --outstyle=summary
           --outstyle=yaml
          which now defaults to "summary" to ease interactive use.

0.09      2010-07-07
        - new benchmark to stress MooseX::Declare method calls

        - provide Devel::Platform::Info with cmdline option -p

        - allow generic defines vie -Dkey=value
          - usually to configure plugins

        - refactored use of env variables, now all set via cmdline
          options:
            --fastmode
            --usethreads
            -DThreads_threadcount=64

        - now requires Perl 5.8

0.08      2010-05-11
        - new benchmark around running Perl6 STD.pm / gimme5 / viv

        - new benchmark using DPath to stress lookup, traversing and
          copying data structures

        - scaled down too aggressive Shootdown benchmarks:
          - knucleotide
          - binarytrees
          - nbody

0.07      2010-04-16
        - Bummer! ::Cargo is required.

0.06      2010-04-14
        - Bummer! "More robustness" in 0.05 must have sounded like an
          euphemism for "now crashing reliably". Fix tests by using the
          Data::YAML::Reader which is the sister of the YAML generating
          module Data::YAML::Writer. Other YAML modules occasionally break.

0.05      2010-04-12
        - search executables like sa-learn or prove only besides $^X

        - more yaml robustness tries as they all crash in a different
          way on strange platforms; do some some eval-style try/catch
          en passant...

0.04      2010-04-12
        - sub-plugins (like Shootout/*.pm) now get same place in result
          hash regardless of beeing started as part of bundle, i.e via
          --plugins=Shootout or directly via --plugins=Shootout::foo. This
          makes evaluation easier.

        - most dependencies now only "recommends" but take care cou
          install them anyway, eg. via PERL_AUTOINSTALL=--defaultdeps

        - output overall runtime

        - distro maintenance: meta info, test cleanup, verbose debug
          printing

0.03      2010-04-03
        - doc fixes

        - add re::engine::Plan9 to benchmark of regex engines

0.02      2010-04-01
        - YAML improvements for easier embedding into TAP
          - verbose text now looks like TAP # diagnostics
          - new commandline --tapdescription="some description" to generate
            a leading "ok some description" line before the YAML

        - took out some benchmarks from default plugin list that
          occasionally segfaulted

0.01      2008-08-12
        - Initial version
