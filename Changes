  - drop tests that require dependencies

0.32      2012-09-18
  - fix dependency cleanup, no more [AutoPrereqs]

0.31      2012-09-07
  - very few dependencies now,
    not even Perl::Formance::Cargo anymore,
    completely rely on Task::PerlFormance for that
  - therefore now more usable for quick microbenchmarks
  - capture more errors and handle gracefully
  - avoid output flooding

0.30      2012-08-17
  - set $0 to plugin name
    (sorry for the micro releases, I'm on vacation :-))

0.29      2012-08-17
  - FibMXDeclare: disabled in --plugins=ALL
    (it is extremely too slow to make any sense)

0.28      2012-08-16
  - Dist::Zill'ified
  - depend on newer Devel::Size
  - remove legacy MooseTS code completely
  - Plugin::DPath without Safe.pm
  - rework P6STD plugin to work again
  - polish debug/verbose output

0.27      2012-05-24
  - conditionally use Devel::Size only if available

0.26      2012-01-26
  - MooseTS: disabled in --plugins=ALL
    This benchmark idea turned out to not work as
    expected. Disable it for easier living.

  - RegexpCommonTS: no more in with prove -Q (quiet) mode as under
    circumstances with 5.9.x quirks that's not available. It makes
    the benchmark slightly slower.

0.25      2012-01-04
  - fix SpamAssassin plugin (set used Bayes plugin explicitely)

0.24      2011-11-22
  - modify variation in exe names for codespeed: now only perl-5.15
    in contrast to perl-5.15.5, but additionally name threads and
    64bit-support.

0.23      2011-08-13
  - Codespeed support
    it can generate additional data blocks in TAP that
    already fit the structure needed by Codespeed
    (http://github.com/tobami/codespeed)

0.22      2010-08-04
  - Big Rescale
    - The --fastmode is now slower but actually returning useful
      values for experimenting speed improvements or configurations.
      This probably makes it the preferred mode for everyday users.
    - The normal mode (targeted to compare real strong machines)
      now takes less time on some crazy workloads that went mental
      even for big machines.

  - some more tests

0.21      2010-07-30
  - Maintenance release
    - fixed missing PLUGIN_VERSION in output
    - fix missing plugin titles
    - document --plugins=ALL
    - drop dependency to Test::Aggregate::Nested (orphaned experiment)

  - introduced an "Incubator" plugin as an experimental,
    non-official playing field

0.20      2010-07-27
  - default set of plugins now "mostly harmless", ie., which
    should work with same dependencies as Perl::Formance itself:
    - Fib FibOO, Mem, Prime, Rx, fasta, regexdna, binarytrees,
      revcomp, nbody, spectralnorm
    - additionaly a new --plugins=ALL option which runs all known
      plugins.

  - all plugins now have their own version numbers

  - RxCmp plugin: new re::engine::RE2

  - Mem plugin: now implemented something

  - Threads plugin:
    - less inner thread overhead
    - divides Threads + ThreadsShared

  - PerlCritic plugin: runs Perl::Critic on itself, using a bundled
    snapshot or the installed CPAN version, both on the snapshot
    code

  - Bugfixes and maintenance
    - forgotten tmpdir cleanups
    - code cleanup for Perl::Critic
    - try hiding bundled code from PAUSE indexer
    - Perl 5.8'ify by using "our"
    - dropped useless exports

  - new option --version
    - in combination with -v prints all plugin versions

  - Stabilize OS run environment (mostly Linux)
    - disk sync
    - flush caches
    - disable Core Performance Boost
    - disable Adress Space Layout Randomization
    - These features will need "root" to have an effect

  - Now every plugin is forked before running.

  - No more all plugin loading at once; as that used to influence
    the runtime of plugins depending on what else was loaded.

0.12      2010-07-13
  - Adapt to changed DPath API v0.40

0.11      2010-07-10
  - Imroved --outstyle=summary output

0.10      2010-07-09
  - introduce output style option
     --outstyle=summary
     --outstyle=yaml
    which now defaults to "summary" to ease interactive use.

0.09      2010-07-07
  - new benchmark to stress MooseX::Declare method calls

  - provide Devel::Platform::Info with cmdline option -p

  - allow generic defines vie -Dkey=value
    - usually to configure plugins

  - refactored use of env variables, now all set via cmdline
    options:
      --fastmode
      --usethreads
      -DThreads_threadcount=64

  - now requires Perl 5.8

0.08      2010-05-11
  - new benchmark around running Perl6 STD.pm / gimme5 / viv

  - new benchmark using DPath to stress lookup, traversing and
    copying data structures

  - scaled down too aggressive Shootdown benchmarks: 
    - knucleotide
    - binarytrees
    - nbody

0.07      2010-04-16
  - Bummer! ::Cargo is required.

0.06      2010-04-14
  - Bummer! "More robustness" in 0.05 must have sounded like an
    euphemism for "now crashing reliably". Fix tests by using the
    Data::YAML::Reader which is the sister of the YAML generating
    module Data::YAML::Writer. Other YAML modules occasionally break.

0.05      2010-04-12
  - search executables like sa-learn or prove only besides $^X

  - more yaml robustness tries as they all crash in a different
    way on strange platforms; do some some eval-style try/catch
    en passant...

0.04      2010-04-12
  - sub-plugins (like Shootout/*.pm) now get same place in result
    hash regardless of beeing started as part of bundle, i.e via
    --plugins=Shootout or directly via --plugins=Shootout::foo. This
    makes evaluation easier.

  - most dependencies now only "recommends" but take care cou
    install them anyway, eg. via PERL_AUTOINSTALL=--defaultdeps

  - output overall runtime

  - distro maintenance: meta info, test cleanup, verbose debug
    printing

0.03      2010-04-03
  - doc fixes

  - add re::engine::Plan9 to benchmark of regex engines

0.02      2010-04-01
  - YAML improvements for easier embedding into TAP
    - verbose text now looks like TAP # diagnostics
    - new commandline --tapdescription="some description" to generate
      a leading "ok some description" line before the YAML

  - took out some benchmarks from default plugin list that
    occasionally segfaulted

0.01      2008-08-12
  - Initial version
